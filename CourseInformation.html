<h3>Academic Integrity, Research, and Proper Citation</h3>
<p>As an online student, you are encouraged to reach out to your fellow students in the online classroom to discuss materials and ask each other questions, but there are limits to this collaboration. Reviewing lecture and reading materials and studying for exams can be enjoyable and enriching things to do with fellow students. This is recommended. However, unless otherwise instructed, homework assignments are to be completed independently, and materials submitted as homework should be the result of your own independent work.</p>
<p>As a UC Berkeley student you are bound by the <a href="http://extension.berkeley.edu/upload/academic_integrity.pdf" target="blank">UC Berkeley Extension Academic Integrity, Research and Proper Citation,</a> which clearly defines what constitutes cheating, as well as plagiarism and other forms of academic misconduct.</p>
